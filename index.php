		<h2 class="title">We are not an estate agent. </h2>
		<h2 class="text-center">We have a simple, effective model which connects you to potential buyers for the private sale of your home. Even if you have a sole agency agreement with an agent you can still advertise your property on our website. </h2>

	<h2 class="title">How does it work? </h2>

	<p class="text-center">1. Register your details and add your property description and photographs</br>
	2. You have your own private secure Property Wing inbox in which you will receive requests directly from potential buyers.</br>
	3. We add your property to our Facebook page and boost it so that it gets seen by thousands of people in and around your area.</br>
	4. We set up an advert on Google so that when people search the internet for properties for sale in your area, they will find yours right up there!</br>

	<h2 class="title"><strong>This is all completely free of charge.</strong></h2>

<h3 style="margin-left:16px;font-size: 19px;">How to value your property</h3>

<p class="index-contant">The real value of your property is the amount that someone is prepared to pay you for it.  Factors that will influence their decision are size, location, internal decoration, unusual features, amount of land included in the sale, proximity of local schools, public transport and amenities.  </p>

<p class="index-contant">Traditionally estate agents would rely on their own bank of sold prices, which were not available to the general public, upon which to base their valuations.  Even then, there were large differences in the valuations provided by different estate agents when asked to value the same property.  Nowadays the internet is full of information such as house price comparables, sold prices, house price indexes and so on.  The lay person is therefore able to make an informed judgement as to the value of their property.</p>

<p class="index-contant">To value your property, the starting point is to look at our       page.  This gives details of sold prices since 1995.  You may then want to look at the National House Price Index website which allows you to calculate a possible valuation based on movements in the sale prices for a typical property in the various regions of the UK.  You should then look at current comparable house prices for properties on the market or recently sold on websites such as rightmove or zoopla and on the websites of your local estate agents.  You must be aware and take into account that houses do not always sell for the price at which they are advertised and often properties are sold before they are even advertised for sale.</p>

<p class="index-contant">It is important not to over value your property as this will put off prospective purchasers.  Remember that prospective purchasers will have access to the same information as you and will have done their own research before considering a purchase.  Over pricing may also have a knock on effect because if your property remains unsold for too long, prospective purchasers it may give the impression that the property is in some way undesirable, having not been snapped up.  It could also lead to problems when the property is valued for mortgage purposes by a prospective purchaser.  Even where the purchaser may be prepared to pay an inflated price, their lender may not approve their mortgage if the lenderâ€™s valuer places a lower value on the property. </p>

<p class="index-contant">If you are concerned that you may undervalue your property, then the best way to cover yourself is to ask for offers in excess of your initial asking price.  If it is undervalued it is sure to attract a lot of inerest and you will be able to negotiate upwards to the correct price.</p>

<p class="index-contant">You must therefore be realistic about the decorative condition and any unusual features which may impact, either upwards or downwards on the comparable of value of your property to those you have been looking at.</p>
